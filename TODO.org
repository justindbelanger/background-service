* TODO move Java-specific stuff into a separate namespace
Wrap the classes with idiomatic Clojure
Mad scientist goal: write the main functionality in CLJC and wrap JavaScript and Java integrations, so the service can run in either environment!
* RESOLVED Support multiple clients
  CLOSED: [2019-03-30 Sat]
Just need to spawn a new thread or something similar, so each client can have a concurrent conversation.
* TODO launch the service in the background
Using the operating system's tools, run the service as a daemon/in the background.
* TODO live repl support
Spawn a REPL inside the running service and allow clients, e.g. CIDER, to connect and inspect the current state
